        <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h3>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science dedicated to creating
          machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
          This encompasses a wide range of capabilities, including:
        </p>
        <div className="ai-capabilities">
          <p>
            Learning: Acquiring information and rules for using the
            information.
          </p>
          <p>Reasoning: Using logic to draw conclusions and make decisions.</p>
          <p>Problem-solving: Identifying and finding solutions to complex issues.</p>
          <p>Perception: Understanding sensory input such as vision, speech, and touch.</p>
          <p>Language understanding: Processing and interpreting human language.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Think of AI as the overarching goal â€“ to build intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and take actions to maximize their chance of successfully achieving their goals. This ambition has driven decades of research and development, leading to the sophisticated AI systems we see today.
